**Controlling a Robot with a Game Controller Using the GamepadController Class**

Ever used devices like keyboards or game controllers? If so, you've likely come across HID, or Human Interface Device. This system helps these devices talk easily with computers. The best part? Plug them in, and your computer instantly gets it.

Before we dive in, it's key to note: we'll be using a class I wrote named `GamepadController`. Also, make sure you have a Python setup ready to use.

And don't forget to connect your Radiomaster tx16s game controller. You can do this with a USB cable or wirelessly with Bluetooth.

Now, if you're back for more in our DIY spider robot seriesâ€”welcome! If you're new, I'd suggest checking out our earlier episodes first.

Today, we'll cover:
1. Finding all connected HID devices.
2. Linking up with the game controller.
3. Understanding the signals from the controller.
4. Setting up the controller channels.
5. Moving the robot with the controller's commands.

For those wanting more details and tools, check out the description below.

Starting with **Step 1**: To see the connected HID devices, use the `list_hid_devices` method from the GamepadController class. We'll be mainly looking for the Radiomaster tx16s.

Moving to **Step 2**: Once you find the controller, it's time to connect. With the GamepadController class, this is simple. Just use the device's name, like "Radiomaster tx16s".

Next, **Step 3**: It's important to get how HID device data is sent. A single channel usually sends info using two different values: a main value and a multiplier. When mixed, they give a wider data range. The `GamepadController` class handles this with the `process_input` method. By using the `print_raw_data` method and moving the controller sticks, you'll see the signals change in real time.

Onto **Step 4**: Being exact is key. The GamepadController class lets you pick channels, like throttle and roll. After that, the `read_controller` method gives a quick view of each channel.

Wrapping up with **Step 5**: Now for the fun part! With the controller's signals, you can make the robot move and react.

In short, using a game controller to guide a robot mixes tech know-how with fun. A match made in heaven!
