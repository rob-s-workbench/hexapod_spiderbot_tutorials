Hello, everyone! Welcome back to our exciting series on building a spider robot. 

Before we start, just a quick reminder. This tutorial is part of a comprehensive series that I've created to guide you through the process of building a spider robot. Each tutorial in the series is designed to cover a specific aspect of the project, providing detailed instructions and insights to help you understand and replicate the steps. You can find the entire series linked in the description below. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, I hope you find these resources helpful and informative. Let's get building!

Before we dive into the specifics, I want to point out that this repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and visualizations. This can be a great resource as you follow along with this tutorial.

Today, we're focusing on a crucial aspect of robot motion planning - the Forward Kinematics Method. We're going to delve into this concept, specifically exploring the `forwardKinematicsNaive` method in our `SpiderLeg` class.

Now, if you're new to the term 'Forward Kinematics', it's a method we use in robotics to predict where the robot's limbs will be based on their joint angles. Essentially, it's about predicting the pose of a robot given its joint parameters.

For a spider-like robot, which could be a quadruped or hexapod robot, forward kinematics would involve determining the position of each of its feet given the angles of its joints. Each leg of the robot is typically a kinematic chain, with joints that allow movements in specific directions.

In practical terms, forward kinematics allows the robot to plan its movements. If the robot's brain decides to move a specific leg to a certain position, it can use inverse kinematics to calculate the necessary joint angles, then move the joints to those angles, and use forward kinematics to check that the leg ended up in the right place.

Before we dive into the code, let's touch upon some basic trigonometry concepts that are used in this method. Don't worry if you're not a math person; I'll keep it simple.

We'll be talking about Sine, Cosine, Tangent, and the Pythagorean theorem. These concepts allow us to calculate the lengths of sides in a right triangle when an angle is known, or to find an angle when the lengths of the sides are known. They form the basis for many geometric calculations and transformations, including those used in our forward kinematics.

Now, let's dive deeper into our `forwardKinematicsNaive` method. This method calculates the position of each joint in the robot's leg based on the current angles of the joints.

Step 1. The code starts by checking if any joint angles were provided as input to the method. If no angles were provided, it uses the current angles of the leg.

Step 2. It then stores the current angles of the leg from the `SpiderLeg` object into the variable `angles`.

Step 3. The code then converts these angles from degrees to radians. This is because trigonometric functions in Python use radians, not degrees.

Step 4. The x and y coordinates of the joint between the coxa (or hip) and femur (or thigh) segments of the leg are calculated. This gives us the horizontal and vertical distances from the base of the leg to the hip joint.

Step 5. The code calculates the vertical component of the length of the femur segment. 

Step 6. We then compute the horizontal component of the length of the femur segment.

Steps 7. The x and y coordinates of the femur-tibia joint, or the "knee" of the spider leg, are calculated. These coordinates give us the position of the knee in relation to the base of the leg.

The next set of lines calculate the x, y, and z coordinates for the tibia-tip joint, which is the endpoint of the leg. The calculations involve trigonometric functions and geometric relationships to determine the position of this joint based on the angles of the other joints.

First, we calculate `H`, which represents the straight-line distance from the femur-tibia joint to the tibia-tip joint. This is done using the Law of Cosines, with the angle being the difference between 180 degrees and `theta3`. 

The `phi1`, `phi2`, and `phi3` values are auxiliary angles used to compute the position of the tibia-tip joint. 

Next, `Pp` represents the horizontal projection of the tibia-tip joint on the plane of the femur. 

`P2` is then calculated as the difference between `Pp` and `P1` (the horizontal projection of the femur-tibia joint). 

The final `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates of the tibia-tip joint (`Xb`, `Yb`, and `G1`) are then computed using these auxiliary values.

The final output of the method is a list of joint locations, with each location represented by a list of x, y, and z coordinates.

That's it! You've just learned how the `forwardKinematicsNaive` method works. It's an elegant piece of code that uses simple trigonometry to calculate the position of each joint in the robot's leg based on the current angles of the joints.

Remember, the beauty of robotics lies not just in the final product, but in the intricate processes that bring the robot to life.
