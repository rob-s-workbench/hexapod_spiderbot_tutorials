[**Visual Transition: Opening Slide for Today's Tutorial**]

**Narrator:** "Today, we're focusing on a crucial aspect of robotic movement in our spider robot - the forward kinematics method. Let's break down this concept and see how it brings our robot to life."

[**Visual: Diagram of Spider Robot**]

**Narrator:** "Imagine each leg of our robot as a mini-chain of joints and segments. Forward kinematics is our tool to figure out where the tip of each leg will be, based on the angles of these joints. Think of it like predicting where your hand ends up when you move your arm, without looking."

[**Visual: Basic Trigonometry Slide**]

**Narrator:** "To understand this better, we need to touch upon some trigonometry basics. Trigonometry is all about angles and sides of triangles. Don't worry, we'll keep it simple."

[**Visual: Sine, co-sign, and Tangent Illustrations**]

**Narrator:** "First, the sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is a ratio - the length of the side opposite the angle to the triangle's longest side, called the hypotenuse. co-sign is similar, but it's the side next to the angle over the hypotenuse. Tangent is the sine divided by the co-sign."

[**Visual: The Law of co-signs**]

**Narrator:** "Next, The Law of co-signs, a more generalized version of the Pythagorean theorem that applies to any triangle, not just right-angled ones. The Law of co-signs helps us relate the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the co-sign of one of its angles. It's particularly useful in robotics, where we often deal with non-right triangles formed by the robot's joints and limbs."

[**Visual: Transition to Spider Robot Leg Diagram**]

**Narrator:** "Now, let's apply these concepts to our spider robot's legs using the `forward_kinematics_naive` method."


[**Visual: Code Snippets and Leg Diagrams**]

**Narrator:** "We start by converting the angles of our robot's joints from degrees to radians. We use radians in these calculations because they provide a more natural way to describe angles in terms of their relation to the circle, which is essential in robotic movements."

[**Code Example: Angle Conversion**]

**Narrator:** "Next, we calculate the positions of each joint. Using sine and co-sign, we find the x and y coordinates for our robot's coxa joint, coxa-femur joint, and the femur-tibia joint."

[Visual: Highlighted Code Snippet]

Narrator: "First, we determine the x and y coordinates of the coxa-femur joint. This joint acts like the connection point in a human leg, linking the body to the upper leg segment."

[Visual: Illustration of Coxa-Femur Joint with Coordinates]

Narrator: "Using trigonometry, we calculate 'Xa', the horizontal position, and 'Ya', the vertical position, of this joint. We multiply the length of the coxa segment by the co-sign and sine of the coxa joint angle, respectively. This gives us precise coordinates based on our joint's current angle."

[Visual: Animated Calculation of Xa and Ya]

Narrator: "Next, we focus on the femur segment of our robot. We calculate its vertical and horizontal components. The vertical component, 'G2', is found by multiplying the femur's length by the sine of the coxa-femur joint angle, representing the vertical positioning of the femur-tibia joint."

[Visual: Illustration of Femur with Vertical Component]

Narrator: "Similarly, the horizontal component, 'P1', is the femur's length times the co-sign of the coxa-femur joint angle. This tells us the horizontal positioning of the femur-tibia joint relative to the coxa-femur joint."

[Visual: Animated Calculation of G2 and P1]

Narrator: "Finally, we calculate the x and y coordinates of the femur-tibia joint. By applying the horizontal component 'P1' to our previous calculations, we can pinpoint this joint's exact location in space."
**Narrator:** "The horizontal extension, 'X.c.', is determined by multiplying the length of the femur segment (represented by the horizontal component 'P1') by the co-sign of the coxa joint angle. This gives us the horizontal distance from the coxa-femur joint to the femur-tibia joint."

**Narrator:** "Similarly, the vertical extension, 'Y.c.', is found by multiplying the same femur length (the horizontal component 'P1') by the sine of the coxa joint angle. This calculation gives us the vertical distance from the coxa-femur joint to the femur-tibia joint."



[**Visual: Detailed Illustration of Spider Robot's Leg Joints**]

**Narrator:** "Let's focus on the femur-tibia joint, a key point in our leg's movement. We calculate the straight-line distance from the femur-tibia joint to the tibia tip using the Law of co-signs."

[**Visual: Illustration of the Femur, Tibia, and Angles**]

**Narrator:** "The Law of co-signs helps us find one side of a triangle when we know the other two sides and the angle between them. In our case, the sides are the lengths of the femur and tibia segments, and the angle is at the femur-tibia joint."

[**Visual: Equation of the Law of co-signs**]

**Narrator:** "Here's the formula: The square of the length of the side we want to find (the distance from the femur-tibia joint to the tibia tip) is equal to the sum of the squares of the femur and tibia lengths, minus twice their product multiplied by the co-sign of the angle at the femur-tibia joint. Mathematically, it looks like this."

[**Visual: Calculation Steps for H**]

**Narrator:** "By inputting the lengths of the femur and tibia, and the angle at the femur-tibia joint, we can solve for H, the straight-line distance from the femur-tibia joint to the tibia tip."

[**Visual: Breaking Down H into Horizontal and Vertical Components**]

**Narrator:** "With H known, our next task is to break this distance into horizontal and vertical components - this will give us the 'Xb' and 'Yb' coordinates of the femur-tibia joint. For this, we calculate additional angles at the coxa-femur and femur-tibia joints."

[**Visual: Trigonometric Formulas for Additional Angles**]

**Narrator:** "Using more trigonometry, we calculate these angles. We first find 'phi1', the angle at the coxa-femur joint, using the Law of co-signs again. This law helps us understand the relationship between H, the femur, and the tibia."

[**Visual: Equation for phi1**]

**Narrator:** "The formula for 'phi1' is \( \phi1 = \arccos\left(\frac{\text{FEMUR}^2 + H^2 - \text{TIBIA}^2}{2 \times \text{FEMUR} \times H}\right) \). This tells us the angle at the coxa-femur joint."

[**Visual: Calculation of  phi3**]

**Narrator:** "'phi3', an auxiliary angle, is then determined by subtracting the original angle at the coxa-femur joint from 'phi1'. These angles are crucial for determining the position of the femur-tibia joint."

[**Visual: Horizontal and Vertical Projections of H**]

**Narrator:** "Now, we use 'phi3' to find the horizontal projection 'P.p.' of the femur-tibia joint on the plane of the femur. This is calculated using the co-sign of 'phi3' multiplied by H. The horizontal distance between the coxa-femur joint and the femur-tibia joint, 'P2', is then the difference between 'P.p.' and the horizontal projection of the femur."

[**Visual: Final Calculation of Xb and Yb**]

**Narrator:** "Finally, we calculate 'Xb' and 'Yb', the x and y coordinates of the femur-tibia joint. These are found by using the sine and co-sign of the original coxa joint angle, multiplied by 'P.p.'. The vertical component of the femur-tibia joint, 'G1', is found using the sine of 'phi3' and H, and it might be negated depending on the robot's coordinate system orientation."

[**Visual: Overview of Joint Position Mapping**]

**Narrator:** "Now, let's connect the dots between our calculations and the robot's joint positions. Each of these intricate calculations - from the Law of co-signs to the determination of angles 'phi1', 'phi3' - plays a pivotal role in pinpointing the exact location of each joint in the robot's leg. The x and y coordinates we calculated for the coxa, coxa-femur, and femur-tibia joints - 'X.a.', 'Y.a.', 'X.b.', 'Y.b.', and so on - are more than just numbers; they represent the precise spatial coordinates where each joint should be positioned. By mapping these coordinates onto our robot, we can visualize and control the movement and articulation of each leg with incredible accuracy. This precise mapping is what allows our spider robot to move fluidly and respond accurately to our commands, making the journey from mathematical concepts to mechanical reality."

[Visual: 3D Animation of Spider Robotâ€™s Leg]

Narrator: "With our calculations complete, it's time to bring our spider robot's leg to life in the virtual world. Let's see how we map out its joints in our code."

[Visual: Highlighted Code Snippet]

Narrator: "Here, we're creating a list that represents the locations of each joint in the leg. This list is the bridge between our mathematical calculations and the robot's physical structure."

[Visual: Animation Showing Joint Locations Being Added to List]

Narrator: "We start with the origin point, [0, 0, 0], the base from where our leg begins. Next, we add the coordinates of the coxa-femur joint, calculated earlier as 'X.a.' and 'Y.a.'. This joint is crucial as it connects the leg to the robot's body."

[Visual: Illustration of Coxa-Femur Joint with Coordinates]

Narrator: "Then, we move to the femur-tibia joint, crucial for leg articulation. By adding 'X.c.' and 'Y.c.' to our initial coxa-femur coordinates, and including the vertical component 'G2', we locate this joint precisely in three-dimensional space."

[Visual: Illustration of Femur-Tibia Joint with Coordinates]

Narrator: "Lastly, the endpoint of the leg, which interacts with the ground. Its coordinates are determined by adding 'Xb' and 'Yb' to the coxa-femur coordinates and using 'G1' as its vertical position. This marks the endpoint of our leg's journey."

**Narrator:** "And there you have it! By applying these trigonometric principles, we've precisely determined the position of the femur-tibia joint."
